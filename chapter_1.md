ARC 1: Hell

A blank white room, nothing to see. Silent. He found himself standing upright. The shadow appeared.

Where am I? Please, no, no!! Take me home! I want to leave! ple-eease. [Inaudible crunches]

The room had been translucent but had no opening leading to the outside. The shadow smiled as he begged dearly for his life, clinging on to the wall where his blood had painted it dark red. The world outside was deaf to his calls. His body ached and ripped itself apart, his muscles tore out, bones broke into two, and skin burnt like molten lava had been dropped. The pain, was excruciating and unbearable.

He had been rid of his human form now. Such a nasty torcher which fainted him. He collapsed and gave up to the violation. The sobbing had stopped. Shadow stood at the extreme corner, farthest from him for the entire time. Watching as his body underwent metamorphosis.

Opening his eyes to an exclusive image, Nameless didn’t bother blinking. In-front was a macrocosm. Black skies with a reddish glow gradient from the top, with snow hailing to the right with seemingly fatal speeds. Large chunks moreover. The snow was neon blue.

The ground was combined dark rocks, constructing an irregular surface. Their colour was merciless against any light falling; and devoured them like inanimate monsters. Cracks flew infinitely across their oddly geometrical figures. They were like miniature ravines with opposing mountains attached by some mysterious force. Electrostatic maybe? The blizzard prolonged to howl on…

Obnoxiously. ‘What’s that weird thing?’ he whispered to himself.

Deep into the horizon, one could see the bright sheet of light etched onto the crimson painted sky at the distance far, far away, like an unpredictable dream- always like a mirage and ever-fading, existing and not existing at the same time. Portrayed as a sphere floating high above head…it possessed intense white radiance.

Beside it, oddly floated the same stones like a natural staircase, just not in regular manner.

As Nameless advanced, his ground blasted out!

The floor ahead of the child, shot into the air like a slingshot, time to time and spontaneously…but its pace smoothened slowly as it reached the sphere’s height and halted. Despite the rising extra-terra, the rain of sediments from nowhere never seemed to even scratch his bony body.

He now looked up. ‘Whoa!’ He startled.

A ginormous yellow eye stared hard into his soul. The nerve fibres connected to its ends spread into the atmosphere as if he lingered inside a legendary monster gargantuan. It blinked silently while its terrifying glare prolonged on Nameless. The eye ball had a strange, thick, dark blue curvy lining which followed unbelievably trillions of silver threads, stretched and intertwined with extreme tensions to the black pupil at the centre.

Some shiny threads broke open! Like a guitar string. They lengthened and stretched in a calm manner — downwards. ‘They’re feeding tubes’ a light pitched voice calmly touched his ears. Behind him was a maiden. A hell maiden.

He turned.

Nameless observed the ginormous wall of rocks behind before noticing her ghostly face: snow-white, flawless, shiny skin, and most spine-chilling being those holes in across her cheeks, shaped like the wings of a monarch butterfly, somehow holding the jaw with the strained skin connections with the skull’s. Her deeply dark-circled eyes weren’t what you’d say mesmerizing; they lacked eyeballs.

Her hair glided smoothly down from head and brushed on the ground. A stream of brown spiky vines instead of keratin fibres (what humans have) arranged in cornrows; bunned at the top and ponytailed afterwards.

‘They search for Skaqbra around the sector…’ she added, after the short pause.

‘Who…’ He attempted to speak.

Her cheek skin tore open, revealing…tri-split jaw with dragon-sized razor sharp, glistening black fangs leaking out a red syrup from between them. The black cloth wrapped around her body unveiled itself.

From the neck, slid down a long, bare, spinal cord. Organs like lungs, the heart, the stomach, ultimately ending with the intestines that dangled from her pelvic area. His fear burst! Hysteria caught him. Another scar.

Tears rolled down his eyes, he crashed hard on his hips, and remained frozen for the time.

There hadn’t been any skin of her own. It was stolen.

She quietly neared him during those tiny gaps when the storm went silent but that hail continued on,

Until her shadow could touch his mummified body. It charged!

CLENCH!!CRACKLE!!! [Grungy, deafening screeches]

Her artistic fangs locked onto his flesh set on the leg. Nameless’s deafening screams and cries were nothing more than a whisper in this noisy world. His left leg hadn’t been ripped apart. Her mouth let go, releasing a stream of scarlet blood from her still-glossy fangs dripping on the ground.

Racing away from him, she halted shook her fangs with great force such that the blood spilled on the ground. Each tooth could have almost a quarter of a litre stuck onto it, a result of centuries of hardened blood that formed the black plaque. Before the next blink, he saw the silver wires bolting towards the ground.

CRASH!!

They disappeared without leaving a trace, like a smart burglar; a blood burglar. Like a whip, they smashed the tough footstones into cinders and retracted back into the eye into strong positions denoting they had never left it above, like naughty children hiding behind their parents’ might and grandeur after a dirty prank.

She returned to her veil as it mysteriously climbed up and covered her body, her jaws connected back. The skin connections were intact for some strange reason! Her face had reverted back into a normal size, yet she floated above-ground.

‘Kindly spare me, I haven’t done anything wrong! I just arri-’ [interrupted] ‘Do you support any god?’ her eyes pierced through his presence. ‘I am an a-aeth-atheist, I despise them’.

Her smile wasn’t clearly visible but inferential from her blank face.

‘Your flesh tasted like a mortal, I’ll give you, my name.’

‘Stygian.’

“It longs for flesh, because blood is a feast; that of a mortal, being a scrumptious delight”, Stygian told in a confident deep tone.

“Don’t you too? I mean, your fangs…” Nameless pointed his finger towards her suspended jaw, making sure to keep the hand near his body to prevent sudden bite-offs. She stared at him, emotionless, during a pause.

“True, my fangs are made for slashing through tissue, so I feed on dead things to keep my urges in control-”, she responded with a faint smile, though it could only persuade half of him. “Why save me?” he questioned, interrupting. “Because you don’t side with the gods”.

Nothing was clear. The term “Gods” had become ever-confusing. Neither had he encountered any, nor was there any relevance with those of the living world.

“That [looks upwards] is [inaudible], the overseer of this world. She possesses the code of gluttony: It forces addictions and urges to devour anything unusual in its view.” Stygian introduced. “Looks menacing. Hey! What is this place? Do you know why am I here? Is it safe to converse with you?” Nameless’s curiosity and fear bombarded her in form of questions.

“You’re new? No wonder you have tasty plasma!” He readied himself to run. Suspicion was rising. “Welcome”.

“To Zhimako-mu! the world of fatal nightmares. My race calls it Zimak since our tongues are longer than the length of our faces, so it’s hard to pronounce.” [slides out tongue]

Magenta in colour, its width reduced and thickness thinned, as his eyes reached its tip, wondering how the saw-like teeth won’t harm its bottom. “What do you mean by race? Are there more of you?” Nameless gulped a pint of saliva. “Yes, we’re called Krada…or rogue demons”. He gulped again.

“Where shall I go now? Krada?” He leaked. “The storm will only get stronger, though your burnt skin’s adapted to the hail, you’ll soon be devoured by Argenticulus.” Stygian’s speech had smoothened; she paused less often now. DISCORD NITRO: 325dfU8z6RXMJuAr9BuM9pjn

“I’ll have to leave right away then!!” He stood up on his slender legs, turned around and paused for a second. if I put enough impact on the rocks, it’ll shoot me upwards. I can escape this place. Can I? Is it even possible? He rushed. Slamming his weight on the stone beneath as if it was a trampoline, he catapulted into the sky. CRASH!

A meteor-sized boulder caught the airborne figure within a few blinks. “I-I don’t feel…pain?”. It felt like the whole nervous system had become dormant, as if someone had sliced off the neuron connections to his brains with nanoscopic efficiency. A shadow rose over him, buried and fused into the mountain wall like screws on a tire rim.

“The Krada has another thing apart from codes of sin…” the similar voice cackled lightly from the dark figure upfront.”…you have a holy curse we cherish so I cannot spare you” her smile had been the boldest and most visible now of all time.

Such wide and curved that her chewing-needles happily revealed themselves out of the white lips. Her eyes lit up with a distinct white shine. “You see, this skin…it’s not mine. It’s stolen. I’d love to have yours…” [smile fades]

He couldn’t move. Some tattoos were soon spreading over his body like wriggling snakes- glowing white, fluorescent tattoos. They resembled chains. Stygian’ s face seemed simultaneously astonished and furious.

“Ugh! It’s the curse! Mind it. Once it wears off, I’ll come for your smooth skin and exchange our nerves so that I can beautify myself again!” her giggles reverberated in the silent weather.

Stygian Krada, was Ocula, the now-deceased, goddess of beauty.

A strange mist had his vision blinded with a white screen. He was back in the white box. The box of permanent trauma, scarring memories, despised recollections.

Then he looked at himself. His limbs were pinned to the room walls by giant knife-like weapons stuck to them, piercing through the tissue and bones. Then the pain struck like a lightning bolt. It knocked the soul out of him. The shadow had disappeared. “Please don’t leave me, pleae-”

[INAUDIBLE SCREECHES]

Instantly, reality changed. From a blank, suffocating room to a pink ceiling and distant voices. Familiar ones. He had difficulty breathing, wearing an oxygen mask. The voices became louder yet they resonated and there was a silent strong beeping in the air. The place seemed isolated.

The only thing he could see was the ceiling. “Sweetie?” a voice called out. “Ma’am, please stop” another voice called. “Sweetie!! here!!” she sobbed and shouted at the top of her lungs. “ma’am, please stop or we may need to call the guards here.do you want it?”. It felt as if she was facing any resistance to reach him.

His limbs were unresponsive. Voice broken.

Thinking creatively now, “Was it Stygian’s teeth toxin? How was there numbing?” He could see a ceiling; not a raging red storm or a blood-loving mutated incarnation of pure horror!

“Terminate them” he heard himself?! “Terminate?” He thought. The voice was similar to Shadow’s. A new barge of red knives again stabbed him. He shouted in pain; again. “Terminate them”. This time, cleared his mind. The knives disappeared again and did not return anymore. “Don’t think, if you do in between the metamorphosis, you’ll end up brain dead from the pain”. “Metamor-..what?” That’s when he observed an extremely thin pin, long as a staff slowly piercing through his neck. There was no pain but his neck felt wet.

A thousand knives emerged from nowhere and struck his body. The same ones, on the same position they’d fixed the limbs to the wall. The same pain struck even if he couldn’t have any other feeling. He captured glances of the weapons, they had a silver edge, blue spine, straight edged, colossal like an ancestral giant sword, with a gem studded beautifully in their hilt centres. They were double-edged. He screamed! Mumbling in pain under the mask, tears rushed down his face. He could feel his skin! It wasn’t burnt or cut. It was smooth and flawless. The knives disappeared like volatile alcohol and reappeared like condensing steam every now and then.

Nauseous. Yes, he was. The red colour was spreading through the previously unnoticed white, silk robe wrapped mysteriously around his body. It had soon permeated and dominated the fabric’s natural tint. He couldn’t move his limbs; the blood was spreading.

A face emerges from his left now.

A familiar one. His mother had come to visit him. Her face was flushed and wizened. Shiny streaks of silver hair like lustrous threads of steel revealed themselves among the black ones as they all partially covered her face.

“Aurelius!” She sobbed loudly. The knives had faded away. The only focus was his mom now. He felt guilty of how much pain, how much sorrow he had cursed her with at his departure. All that could be done was to look her in the eye; and try to say “sorry”. It was hard. Aurelius closed his eyes back, into relief, and relaxed. Her presence had soon vanished from his side as of the arrival of a plethora of footsteps rising in loudness from across the hall. Despite the lack, minced words could be heard from the distance…”yes. No… we can’t…impossible…immovable…sorry”.

“He’s already been sedated”.

Aurelius’s eyes snapped open. He startled. “Ya. ya!, No, no”. He recalled having fainted while travelling to some temple her mother spoke off while in his half-conscious bedridden state yesterday. His mother stood with her back turned, upfront.

He could hear the singing of quails, the rustling of leaves and the cold, gentle breeze sliding through his skin. The sounds lasted for an eternity inside the huge dome. There were no openings like windows or wall-gaps but just a massive front gate that surprised him to have passed through it already. After all, the one in control of movement was a wheelchair. Fat pillars encircled the round floor, green moss had grown over them with bougainvillea covering down the gaps. “Ma, wha- what is this place? Are we here for someone?”. His mother did not turn. The illuminated area had turned to a depressing shade of deep grey.

“Ma-” He attempted to approach her, rolling the wheels with his bare hands.

[HIGH PITCHED GIGGLES]

His mother did not turn despite anything.

The wind blew harder than ever, the sky had gone a dark colour: stygian. It only meant one thing in the ancient era, the descending of a being outside the cycle of life. The pieces of steel hung and swayed all over his head; tied to thin, shiny threads, dominating everything except that one opening through which the storm permeated throughout the temple interior. Frequently did they strike, producing soft, sonorous sounds in a rather, noisy manner. Aurelius’ mother stood right beneath the hole. Motionless. And as straight and still as a needle.

The air had gone sooty before he noticed. A wide, blinding beam beam of light struck the centre-pond with the pace of lightning but which hissed rather than crackle, creating a strong, bright beacon of white light. The hissing prolonged.
