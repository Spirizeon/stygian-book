ARC 3: Scythe of white

The ground began to tremble violently. Suddenly, an upward force launched both of them into the air. The roads cracked open and giant splinters with bits of steel rebars protruding out of the cement chunks mischievously went airborne.

Then everything stopped. Like somebody stopped time.

For that second, the world had gone still. The splinters floated up in the air along with Aurelius; around him was a place hanged in the moment before total demolition. Buildings crumbling down like delicate cake, and the ground swallowing them up into the deep nether.

The sky had a defined, dusty color as always. But there was something just so strange, still. His eyes slid down to his hands, they were glowing with white fluid patterns snaking around his body as if the tattoos were living. He’d noticed that, despite so much happening in the background, nothing had happened to him so far.

“That’s a curse.” A voice called out.

His head swinged forward and eyes widened. Infront was Jade. “I knew it wasn’t just an illusion caused by the eclipse!” he thought. Forward was a girl with glistening, flowing white hair, beneath which crimson eyes, and the same tattoos but pale yellowish, most importantly, the cheek scar of a crescent.

An unexpected swoosh of air passed Aurelius. After he opened his eyes, Jade, or perhaps one in place of her, held a long, ivory glaive; with massive blades attached to a dual hilt with a circular opening having a cylindrical grip, leather taped. She spun it like a top on her hand back and forth. Her body twisted and turned like a snake while doing so.

Within the next blink, everything had retained their dynamic nature. But the most frightening things included no ground beneath him, and Jade’s face dead centre in front of his eyes, his neck touching something really cold and burning. Predicting exactly that in the blurry moment…

Decapitation.

Aurelius’s head flew off, leaving behind a fountain of red spewing from his neck while they both flew. Jade jerked the glaive to remove off the blood on it.

She sensed a clearly noticeable tingle of danger up her spine. Her head looked up without hesitation by reflex. It was a black figure; flying with both hand tucked behind its back in a gentlemanly fashion. The only thing Jade noticed special, was its huge white, teethless smile.
