ARC 2: Blood & Butterflies

There lurked a hideous stench of rotten flesh. Flies all over the place. The floor was covered in grime, tiny streams and patches of blood; flowing from every cell.

It was lit by a ceiling with a single luminous stone embedded in it for saving the budget. Its light was sufficient to cast a deep yellow beacon of light amidst the darkness throughout the silent hallways.

Every place, every wall, had been dampened enough to possess a sliminess on them. It had always been like this.

There was never anybody. Nobody to talk to, nobody to listen to, nobody to share or nobody to learn from. Her sphere of life only contained her cell. Her only robes were old rags, torn, and dirty. She scavenged for rats and cockroaches and developed an immunity for a number of diseases after managing to survive through so many painful times.

There wasn’t a need for a nose, the sensation of smell only disgusted her in those permanent surroundings. There wasn’t a need for eyes, the blessing of sight bored her for everything never changed around her. There wasn’t a need for ears. The striking silence had made her already feel deafened for eternity.

Her only wish was to survive. Without reason. For she’d learnt nothing but to survive by her primal instinct. There was a need for a mouth. For it was the mouth that fed her body. All she did was eat, hunt, and sleep. Her dreams; or rather nightmares, consisted of the same individual who occurred over and over, and yet she couldn’t decipher it’s looks. It was a black humanoid figure, with a stretched smile across its face, flaunting the glimmering teeth inside.

She had named it, the Smiling Shadow.

Smiling Shadow had become her regular playmate soon. But not in reality. She played many games with him. Hide & seek, tag etc. The location would change every dream: sometimes it was a cathedral, sometimes a lively forest, open grasslands, bottomless skies, it was a true escape from the suffocating reality she lived in. Dreams were her favourite part of the day.

A different night: Suddenly, there came a different night. Her dreams were no longer dreams but empty situations of staring at the blank screen of black when she closed her eyes. The screen remained still and motionless throughout the nights.

Her patience was soon fading when she didn’t meet her only friend, Smiling Shadow for so, so many nights. It was as if a cherished toy had been taken from a baby. She’d cry herself to sleep. She couldn’t! It turned out; she was desperately trying to fall asleep. To meet it again. To play with it again.

But it never came. Next came, anger…she’d throw tantrums. But nobody would be there to attend to her. In-fact, her friend hadn’t even come to console her! She was going crazy, wanting to escape the place. Her only enemies were the unshakeable, stout, metal bars upfront.

“Do you want power?” A strange voice called out.

“Uhh”

She hadn’t learnt to speak any language.

“Look above you, there must be a curse crest on the ceiling”.

It was indeed there. A large, red circle with confusing patterns of curvy lines and weird handwriting marking its boundary.

Days passed. Everyday, she’d spend her free time lying on the ground, hands behind her head, and eyes fixed on the sight of the crest-mark. What did it mean?

A day came when, while playing with a bone splinter, she catapulted it upwards out of boredom. It crashed hard on the ceiling. But the moment of collision with the crest-mark had set off an accidental reaction which surprised her to death.

The emblem emitted a sound!

It was a very short instant for when she could finally hear somebody else’s voice. To the experienced ear, it might’ve been a simple choiristic melody but to her, it was a new sensation. Day by day, she’d hunt for food, or if not, chew off her overgrown nails and throw some of them onto different parts of the seal.

It radiated a magnificent, bright red light and voiced out beautiful alphabets. By the time she got bored of listening to the entire script, she’d learnt the language. Somehow, she could decipher the meanings even if no one was there to tell her. It read as…

Fuse darkness onto these wings of mine and end their silence that woes.

A new day, she could feel some cramps on her back. The sensations were different, it was as if she had grown an extra limb or two. How odd.

She stood up and moved around, and felt something’s tip, brushing against the ceiling. She was definite it was the ceiling. Turning back surprised her.

It was two colossal wing pairs.

Though they lacked any vibrancy, they gave off a distinct blue reflection on the glowstone’s light and primarily remained grey. They were as thick as the half of her thumb. Well, since it was the only unit, she could use that time. She jumped in excitement, in the meanwhile, one of her back-wings crashed hard and tore open the rigid steel bars like strips of paper glued between the ground and the top.

She didn’t feel much pain.

Marking her first steps outside the cell, the feeling was heavenly yet strange. Her sights were brighter and there was more to the world than she ever imagined.

The hallway was long and everlasting. Her wings were on the way though. But could she move them? She could! Her wings rolled up like a snail, forming a bud formation behind her back. She ran through the corridor. Her breathing was heavy.

At the end of the long, long pathway, she had to turn left to find seemingly strong doors, bolted and reinforced with more bars, and metal. The doors were giant. They had a greyish tint. Their corners seemingly had some dampness and vegetation growing across but it hadn’t been looking like the slightest of rust spots could ever house themselves on the metal surface. There weren’t any glowstones above head but she could clearly see in the dark.

The gates were locked.

Deciding to explore the place instead, she turned back and retreated to the hallway, trudging through all the cells kept distant from each other by a few feet thick walls. Most were empty, some had empty skeletons, one involved dead remains of rats on which a gang of cockroaches fed enthusiastically. Meanwhile, she was being more and more aware of the place. The never-ending corridor, the cells on the left, and an ever-stretching wall on the right, lit gloomily by the luminous stones above head.

The metal bars, safeguarding each unit had its ends minced away by many generations of pests. No wonder they came off so fluidly in her case! Each possessed miniscule bite marks on them. There was nothing much to do but calmly discover the place’s features as a mode of entertainment. The eerie, obnoxious silence prolonged to howl on.

When she finally reached her cell, the crest on the ceiling had disappeared, not the whole, but part of it. The letters that rested atop the illustration had so tidily removed their presence that it was hard to believe if they existed in the first place! Ignorant, she spent another white night in her own, comfy cell. Too much had happened that day for her to absorb.

The second day began when her eyes opened. This time, she could feel her wings even more. She could move them willingly. Again, she made her trip through the hallway, this time, stumbling across a broken mirror inside one of the jails. It was in large, sharp shards, spread all across the ground.

(Picks up)

A sight of a girl. Honey-tan skin, white hair, blood-red eyes and two glowing crescent marks across her cheeks: just like in the crest-mark. The sight was so new, it scared the life out of her and as a result, as a reflex, it was smashed hard into the ground. She’d seen herself for the first time yet, it was obvious, the facial features were completely different from those felt by the hands for all these years.

Dashed out. She raced for the gateway, imagining there was somebody else at the place: a whole lifetime of isolation definitely had built up an instant reaction to moving things bigger than or the size of herself. She banged hard on the metal door.

It didn’t open.

It felt like somebody was silently approaching her. Hysteria. With a final scream, as she turned; she blacked out. The mental impact was too great.

A dream, playing tag with Smiling Shadow.

Her sleep broke. It was the first dream in so many years of empty sleeps. Consciousness struck her again, she quickly reached out her hand towards the back, rummaging for the wings. They weren’t there! But she was still lying at the gate! Turning her head, she saw her humongous wings, shielding her spine and skull against the fall, like a thick blanket. Was it an involuntary reflex? Perhaps it was.

Still confined inside the silent dungeon, she’d make everyday-trips to the cells where broken fragments of mirror and glass were often found. She’d pick them up and scrutinize herself. Especially her crescent marks, which seemed to give the illusion of deep wounds that do not bleed. She found herself beautiful, and learnt to cherish that face even more as the days passed by…

She woke up from a sharp beam of light projecting towards her eyes. The light wasn’t the usual, ordinary one that came from those nasty glowstones but it had a whitish tinge. Everything was in a haze, and then it cleared.

Infinitely stretching, red, rocky and barren landscapes beneath massive crescents of black clouds; a crimson sky with slight touches of dark orange. A ball of light floating high above in the sky. When she looked back, the way had closed itself under the ground stealthily. The air was cold.

The worlds were beautiful. She ran across the empty plain, on the wrinkled red rock floor like a lost soul. She stopped, took a really deep breath, and stretched her limbs upwards. In the process, she could feel her back muscles stretching as well. The wings unfolded and took their widest forms ever.

Swoosh!

There wasn’t any notice. Turning back, she saw nothing, but felt a burning pain creep up her body. Her chest was drenched in thick, blue blood. Inside, a definitive hold through the right lung, with a metal spike stuck to it.

Now, in front of her was a horde of abominations. Krada.

Five of them, they’d strategically and silently encircled her all around. Each of their jaw skin tore open, and the ferocious fangs slowly rose from their gums, their cloaks dropped. She remained motionless. Not by will, by force. The spike had immobilised her. She should’ve died by now. All five of them charged now. One aimed for the leg limb, others for the right forewing, neck, gut. As they drilled in their razor-sharp teeth into her soft skin, relishing its delicious taste, chewing euphorically on the texturous muscle fibres, quenching their bloodthirst, she lay there. Her body slowly descending to the ground as they dig deeper for the irresistible crunch of bones.

She was dead.

A strange red circle shot up into the sky and enlarged, covering the entire area. It had symbols covering the border, glowing with a pinkish-crimson tint.

(The sky lost its vibrancy faster than a wink)

The krada suddenly began to choke badly. Their faces burst into a shower of black blood. Their corpses melted into the liquid. The clouds cleared. The sky lost its colour and white was that dominated. The sun had become a matte ball of black. The ground disappeared.

The black blood merged into a rubber cylinder, that twisted and turn, forming the figure of a girl with a thousand black needles protruding out her back. Each as long as her body. Forming the same outline as a set of monarch butterfly wings. Her skin was as fair as snow, with black eyes and white pupils, with the same symbols wrapping all around her body in crimson red. Her jaw skin tore open, and the same fangs as the krada popped out.

Everything returned to normal when she blinked. But she was still flying, silently and emotionlessly. Quietly, just like the vast emptiness of the empty red plains and the searing yellow sun, her fangs inserted themselves back into their gums and the jaw returned to normal, returning to an almost indistinguishable human form. Her human face, along with the demonic eyes were deadly enough the obliterate the world with its flawless beauty.

The letters around her body were in ancient kradian, spelling “Sentrizhia”, translating to “Fallen goddess of pain”. The one who had called forth Atraxia: The immortal blood showers of hell.
